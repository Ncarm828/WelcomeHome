This is a file created for the sole purpose of updating the project at a later time

Known Issues:
1. There is a an issue when toggling the lights. Currently I set the light to false which turns off all light.
this is not ideal because the user will left in the dark. This was a crude walk around to get things working but a
fix will be needed later on

2. If a user adds another profile with the same name, major problems will occur. Fix this ASAP



Next release ideas:
1. Get color lights
2. Be able to get pictures off the web and used for the profiles
3. Add edit options
4. Create light class that thread safe so you can thread the lights



Notes:

1.Fix Delete - DONE
2. Fix UI it looks horrible
4. clean code up
5. Comment everything that makes not sense
6. Get rid of unused xml files and other useless java files - DONE
7. make new diagrams for the updates
8. Start using threads for database
